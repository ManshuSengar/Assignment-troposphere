## Project Structure
## The project structure is as follows:
├── public 
│   └── index.html 
└── src
    ├── App.js 
    ├── FeeStructure.jsx
    ├── data.json
    ├── index.js

**The public folder contains generically used html that handles the root route with a slightly modified target to src instead of build from the Create React App structure.**

**The src folder contains all the content related to a reactjs application. At the moment we have an App.js which is an entry point for the application and the rest of the components. In data.json our json file is present**
